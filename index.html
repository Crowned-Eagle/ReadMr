                <h3>I am thinking, therefore I am/exist, whenever it is uttered from me, or conceived by the mind, necessarily is true.</h3>
<h4>This proposition purported to form a secure foundation for knowledge in the face of radical doubt. While other knowledge could be a figment of imagination, deception, or mistake, Descartes asserted that the very act of doubting one's own existence served—at minimum—as proof of the reality of one's own mind; there must be a thinking entity—in this case the self—for there to be a thought.</h4>

                <h2>About me & My Hidden Service</h2>
                
                <p>
     I am a Physics Student who is losing faith in Education System of India by each passing day; as the Education system of India doesn't focus on understanding of subject or Physical Interpretation of Mathematical Concepts or Operations. Well that's my honest opinion. While making this observation I  must admit that I am being bit lazy in overcoming this barrier.</br></br>
    .onion is a pseudo-top-level domain host suffix (similar in concept to such endings as .bitnet and .uucp used in earlier times) designating an anonymous hidden service reachable via the Tor network. Such addresses are not actual DNS names, and the .onion TLD is not in the Internet DNS root, but with the appropriate proxy software installed, Internet programs such as Web browsers can access sites with .onion addresses by sending the request through the network of Tor servers. The purpose of using such a system is to make both the information provider and the person accessing the information more difficult to trace, whether by one another, by an intermediate network host, or by an outsider.</br></br>
    Addresses in the .onion pseudo-TLD are opaque, non-mnemonic, 16-character alpha-semi-numeric hashes which are automatically generated based on a public key when a hidden service is configured. These 16-character hashes can be made up of any letter of the alphabet, and decimal digits beginning with 2 and ending with 7, thus representing an 80-bit number in base32. The "onion" name refers to onion routing, the technique used by Tor to achieve a degree of anonymity. </br> </br>
